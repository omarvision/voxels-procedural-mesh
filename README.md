# voxels-procedural-mesh
Click and the mesh adds another voxel. Click and I take away a voxel. A voxel is basically a cube. And like the famous game minecraft, this video goes over how to add and remove voxels from a procedural mesh by clicking on the side of a voxel.  There is also a second script that allows us to control the camera movement so we can fly around the scene space and click anywhere on our voxel composed mesh to add and remove voxels.  After all our voxel procedural mesh is 3D adn we have to be able to move around it.  I know you want the scripts and files for this tutorial so come and get them at my website: http://omarvision.com/Tutorials/Index - and search for voxel
